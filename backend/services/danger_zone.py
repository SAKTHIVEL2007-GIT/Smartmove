SafeCity Loop V2 — Danger Zone & SafeCity Score Service
Calculates road-level Danger Zone Score (0–100) and SafeCity Score (0–100).
Aggregates:
* pothole severity
* hazard frequency
* conflict frequency
* conflict severity
* traffic exposure
* pedestrian exposure
* motorcycle exposure
* repeated observations / persistence
* road importance
* data confidence & coverage
⚠️ Calculated Danger Zone Score — not scientifically validated accident probability.
